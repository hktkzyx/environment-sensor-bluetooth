The official website is here . You can find the correponding hardware repository hktkzyx/environment-sensor-bluetooth-hardware . Description \u00b6 This firmware firstly setup the device pending bluetooth connection. If no connection after a certain limit, i.e., IDLE_LIMIT in the config.h file, the device will start deep sleep and wake up after WAKEUP_INTERVAL seconds. If connected, the device start measure temperature, humidity, and illustration repeatly at the UPDATE_INTERVAL interval seconds, until the remote client disconnect. Onice the remote client is disconnected, deep sleep starts to reduce power assumption. Installation \u00b6 This project is based on PlatformIO . Please install PlatformIO IDE or PlatformIO Core firstly. Then, clone the repository hktkzyx/environment-sensor-bluetooth git clone https://github.com/hktkzyx/environment-sensor-bluetooth.git cd environment-sensor-bluetooth Usage \u00b6 Create your configuation files. cp ./src/config.h.example ./src/config.h If you use PlatformIO IDE, open this project by VSCode and then upload to the hardware. For PlatformIO Core, upload the firmware by the following command: pio run --target upload Contributing \u00b6 Welcome fork this project! I am not professional on the embeded development. I appreciate if you can fix bugs or develop new features. Before your development, please follow the below rules to ensure the code quality. Install pre-commit and follow the Conventional Commits . When pre-commit is installed, run pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t commit-msg And you can also install commitizen to submit your commits. Use clang-format to format your source code. Follow gitflow branch manage strategies. You can install git-flow to manage branches. Then, git config gitflow.branch.master main git config gitflow.prefix.versiontag v git flow init -d License \u00b6 Copyright (c) 2022 hktkzyx.
